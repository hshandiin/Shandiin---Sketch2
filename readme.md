# Sketch 2 

Lately I have been inspired by all the rain we have been getting. In Navajo culture we recognize two forms of rain, male and female. Male rain is more associated with thunderstorms and torrential rain, often occuring during monsoon seasons. Female rain is more of a gentle, slow-moving rain, accompanied frequently by low clouds and mist. Additionally, Female rains are associated with the stirring of the seasons when spring rains bring the high desert to life - this is especially true in the Southwest where our ancestral lands are located. Like much else in our cultural beliefs there is duality introduced in rain and we recognize this equilibrium between the two forces, qualities, and characteristics to enable healthfulness, harmony, and beauty. I wanted to incorporate and share this knowledge visually in my sketch.
